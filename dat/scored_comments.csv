Anyone who has actually played on the Breakaway map now realizes that Sundance and those soldiers were essentially basejumping out of the map boundaries. Like there's literally nothing over there.

"How to make the worst battlefield game ever

- Throw out the unique, beloved, and time proven battlefield formula.
- implement a hero shooter formula instead
- go all in on skins and microtransactions at the expense of overall content.
- make sure the game is not competitive by removing the scoreboard and nerfing the point system.
- make sure people can't play on their favorite maps or select map size etc (no server browser).
- make sure people can't communicate with each other (no voip or all-chat)
-kill the immersion by making everyone look exactly the same, like clones, and add cringey voicelines on top just to make sure the immersion is really dead.
- make the maps too big and empty, with no destruction.
-make sure there are very few weapons and little customization options.
-dumb down wehicle mechanics so that there's no skill needed to operate them, and therefore also no reward associsted with mastering them.
- add tons of bugs",Hepsuuu,2022-01-23T04:51:12Z,0.174

"I really enjoyed the game while I played and the entire time playing it, it really did feel like Battlefield. I'd have to say it felt like 4 the most, given the sheer amount of time I put into 4. The glitches and lag weren't nearly as much of an issue as I had heard, and I was playing at launch. The only reason I stopped playing was because I had no one to play with and battlefield just ain't the same without friends. I'd say besides my shots sometimes not registering, the only real problem I have with the game was it's lack of content on drop. Unfinished products, as they have been called, have been my favorite games to play for a while. Just look at Borderlands 3, easily one of my favorites of all time. I'm more or less the same about Back 4 Blood. What I'm trying to get at is if a game feels clunky or even unfinished at launch, if it's fun, who cares.",It's Time,2022-01-05T08:39:36Z,0.105

Looked promising. Just sucks. The maps are way to big. It feels like your squad is accomplishing nothing when it‚Äôs 100s of people. Make smaller lobbies for conquest. Like 32 on 32 with smaller maps to make it that pure chaos action we use to have. Sucks I‚Äôve been chasing that feeling of playing battlefield 3 for 10 years.,V A,2022-01-02T15:12:19Z,0.156

While it's technically better than the BFV trailer, it's EXTREMELY deceptive to the point that it's kind of immoral to fans of the series. It promises and heavily emphasizes that BF is going back to the old days, yet the actual game is the furthest DICE could've possibly gone from that.

"Corporate greed, lost its identity in a chase to make money from other successful games (Battleroyales), couldn't have coined off its own unique experience supposedly, but turns out it sucks as a BR so they rush to make it a battlefield game again 15 months before the games official release and we get a half baked pile of garbage. The specialists are so cringe it hurts, the original class outfits (pre-warzone release) we're so good. Do Not Support This Game. We paid ¬£100 to beta test before release. The original trailer had everyone suited up hiding their afros and leather belts. U.S and Russia troop encounters have turned into that spiderman meme where they are both pointing at each other. No scoreboard, no game chat. ¬£100 hustled from each of our pockets. I've tried to contact EA and Dice but they don't even answer on their support forums. They've massacred my boy! And to make things worse they are committed to hero characters, I don't want gimmicky characters, that's cringey. I just want a normal geared up soldier, no face, totally ambiguous. They can be a they/them, A-sexual, I don't care that's fine. But I don't wanna see their face, I don't wanna hear them saying how fun everything is. I want them to acknowledge orders, give orders, request support, clear discipline and focus to the importance of the battle, and distinguishable faction outfits. 

(this is the tip of the iceburg, there is so much wrong with this game, and as a games designer myself I see so much that could be changed without much of an overhaul. But this is also a comment on YouTube, I might aswell be farting in the wind I'd probably get a response faster from Dice/EA).

Final thought: If we ever want a Battlefield that we all know and love, this game and that new battleroyale battlefield are making has to fail. It has to fail! We as fans have to restrain ourselves from playing this game. It needs to die and so does the upcoming battleroyale. if it doesnt, Dice/EA will credit all the success to the hero system and that's what we will have forever. Don't buy this game, stop playing it, do not play the future releasing battlefield royale. They manipulated us with this idea that battlefield can be what you make it i.e jet rocket launcher kill, or C4 quad off a building. But that was their way of trying to slip their gimmicky apex hero's into our game. So they could say ""its just a game at the end of the day, battlefield has never been serious and anyone who thinks that is a white sexist male"". It's all a ruse to steal other games player bases who incorporate gimmicks into their Service (FORTNITE AND WARZONE) while being able dismiss anyone who has anything bad to say about the cringeist hero's ever conceived in a AAA service game.

If only you put as much effort into the game as you did this amazing trailer. DICE management effed this game up with their horrendous decisions and it shows in the final product. What they were doing during the 3 years of development and with 6 studios is a big mystery. Bugs at launch would've been normal and fixed in an update or 2 but the abysmal PC performance and loads of missing core mechanics/features is unacceptable at all. I refunded and I hope you make serious improvements in 6 months when I check back not just bugs and performance but adding back core mechanics and features you left out for whatever reason. This trailer is a perfect example of why you shouldnt get too hyped and pre-order. Job well done DICE I guess.,BlackReaper,2021-11-29T07:20:43Z,0.07

"One thing I noticed in the reveal trailer is that they feature generic soldiers. Even the Gameplay trailer doesn‚Äôt have 13 Falck or Rao running around . My theory is that they were still implementing the classes during development (with customization similar to BFV, and probably throws in some Elites like they did in that installment), but DICE‚Äôs greedy overlord EA saw the immense profit that Activision generated by its operator system in Warzone and such and decided at some point to make them implement this bogus system. What a shame. The only thing they did keep their word was that the Portal mode would turn out great, but that‚Äôs only a selling point for the game. Apart from the horrid UI, the terrible bloom, game-breaking bugs and abysmal maps, it seems that Dice has truly lost their magic, and continued to go down the path that would lead to their own undoing.",MAIBAO LoSeR,2021-11-23T13:23:48Z,0.106

"Battlefield 2042 following the same step as CyberPunk 2077, too much hype but the game ended up being trash, even BF 2042 barely scores 3.0 in metacritic which is very laughable. I never understand with people who overhype this trash, even as BF fans i already know this game will become truly garbage after seeing the direction of this game. The way Dice makes trailer ""only in battlefield moments"" is just deceiving, they try anything to makes the game overhype but actually they didn't show what the game actually is. 

Sadly many people are so dumb to fall into this trap, i keep reminding them that BF 2042 will become Cyberpunk 2077 they never listen to me and instead backslash me, now see what happens, where are those many people who attacking my opinion now? they all gone, they feel ashamed after attacking my opinion about this CashgrabField 2042.",RunningInThe90s,2021-11-21T11:16:21Z,0.189

"This is so sad. Top 10 worst things about this game rn

1. Specialists not being locked into classes and looking the same for both teams.
2. Weapon bloom and balance issues (which lowers the skill ceiling, and makes it more random which is lame)
3. No scoreboard & stats page, all chat, no voice chat
4. Who ever designed this UI should be fired
5. The map design is horrible
6. Cringy voice-lines at the end of round screen
7. Squads are locked to only 4 people
8. Only 2 gamemodes, 22 weapons, and 7 maps is a joke
9. No server browser and after a match everyone gets kicked out of the server
10. Hazard zone should be dead already",Christopher Simonsen,2021-11-20T20:11:33Z,0.24

They completely hid the fact that they've pivoted BF from a relatively serious, grounded experience that takes war seriously, into a bunch of goofy light-hearted unlikable specialists (aka heroes) with the most cringe-inducing catchphrases running around extremely bland environments. BF 2042 can be fun at times, but the tone of this game is so far away from BF and completely lacks the immersion of past titles.",AlexKnappa90,2021-11-17T15:25:13Z,0.079

"We were thinking they are showing us the game is gonna be fun experience with classic Battlefield moments, they were hiding a fact its not near a classic BF experience we had in BF3/4. We were thinking they are showing us gritty soldiers of the future, but these were AI soldiers and sometimes specialists with their goofy faces covered by the only cosmetics items not being a reskins of default one. We were thinking the game is gonna be loaded with action in destruction, in reality its barren wasteland with little to no destruction on certain maps.  We were thinking will 'be fighting on skyscraper's roofs in Korea and Doha, in reality Kaleidoscope has only 4 skyscrapers on the edges of the map noone cares about and Hourglass is mostly a dunes and skyscrapers almost never becomes a point of interest in Breakthrough because the attackers cant win the second stage and reach the city with 3 points with almost no cover required to be capped",FriON,2021-11-15T22:39:26Z,0.127

"This game is like a Chinatown knock off of Battlefield or Dollar store version of GI Joe. Why take great ideas that worked, an amalgamation of features and game mechanics that evolved for 20 years and leave them out? Where is the scoreboard,  classes (actual squad roles), server browser,  any stat page, 100+ fps, squad selection, team switching, UI info (like an option to see damage done with each shot), VOICE CHAT!?!?!  Don't give us the tired old excuse that ""it maybe coming in a future update"" or ""we may add it later"", you took our money (i refunded and got mine back), we expect a finished game.  These aren't bugs that slipped by testers, these are features intentionally left out.Ill buy it again when its $10 on steam and has the features that should have been in the game upon release.Just stick with one of the dozen other Battlefield or similar games that are out , there's no rush to buy a inferior version of something that already exists.",Pat Murphy,2021-11-15T17:41:59Z,0.1
"I really enjoy the battlefield series but I wanted to share something because you guys are most likely open to hearing about how to make it the best experience overall. 

This is from a snipers perspective. 

There‚Äôs something very wrong about hit registration and aim assist. And sniping. 

When having any gun other than a sniper rifle when you‚Äôre shooting at someone and aiming down sights the Aim assist throws you off target. And whenever you try to aim on target and the player moves the opposite direction, when you aim to follow them the Aim assist over pushes your aim off the target. 

When sniping, the aim assist and hit reg is so bad, you just shoot through people. It‚Äôs like the Hitbox around the character is so precisely to the players skin that if you even are 1 millimeter off target, you miss. Like it‚Äôs way too much to the point where pretty much 50% of my shots aren‚Äôt registering. and i myself am a very good sniper but there‚Äôs something wrong with the aiming. Sure, it could be i just have to get used to the game but if you throw me on bf3 bf4 or bf5 I have no issues. 

I haven‚Äôt played enough to know all of the next things I‚Äôm about to say about the scopes, I‚Äôm still on the 6x. but the sniper scopes‚Ä¶ they need scopes with measurements and not just the cross-air line. As a sniper in my opinion this makes me not even want to play it. Coming from bf3 and bf4, It seems like the sniping downgraded. 
There‚Äôs also something weird about the bullet drop. for you snipers that have sniped in bf3 and 4 you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about. In battlefield 2042 500m would be equivalent to about 1000m in battlefield 4. In bf2042 maybe they upgraded in realism‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know but in the sniper scope in Battlefield 4 you would have to aim up at least two measurements in order to calculate a bullet drop of over 500 m. In battlefield 2042 all you have to do is aim like one little small inch to shoot across the map. The sniping feels like a war zone. 
Because it does the same thing.

Battlefield sniping used to be so legendary before battlefield hardline. To me sniping in battlefield is about calculation and all different ranges - Short, medium, and long. 
I have faith in the entire games growth but something I would really like to see is more in-depth sniper scopes and maybe a fix on the bullet drop. Or maybe instead of fixing the whole bullet drop which they probably won‚Äôt do, they could instead make one of those select meter adjustments like they did in battlefield 4. 

I know I‚Äôm going off of bf4 a lot but Battlefield 4 sniping is in my opinion 100% flawless.",CrazyGorillaX,2021-11-15T16:00:08Z,0.139

When you play a game in WW1, WW2, Vietnam, or the Present day, you automatically have expectations for what should and shouldn‚Äôt be in the game for the sake of realism, which is not a bad thing, mind you.

"It sucks. Does not feel like battlefield at all.
BF1 had such a great atmosphere, this one does not. Too much gamma, maps are too big, poor mechanics, grapling hooks and specialists is where the circus and mambo-jambo ruins the BF. If it is a beta, and we should wait, then i wait they rebuild the whole game from scratch.
Where's destruction? Where's immersion? The debris, chaos, explosion one could felt in prrvious BF? TTK is horrible, guns have no punch at all. No customization as it were in BF4? Huge mistake then.
Sound design still bad. 
I understand people dont want their new BF6 to be bad, but it is. 
Yeah patches will work for graphics, some things like ttk or bullet velocity and then they will leave us out, because of the promise of  "" being developing BF7""

"Battlefield 2042 had the most serious addiction attack. Lying in bed, I read the Great Sadness Mantra desperately, and I kept scratching my eyes, thinking that it was all right to brush the Post Bar. As a result, I saw that the Post Bar was in Battlefield 2042, and my eyes were going to explode more and more. I fanned my eyes desperately, and the harder I fanned, the more tears came out. I really didn't know what to do. I really wanted to go crazy in 2042. I think about 2042 when I lie in bed, 2042 when I take a shower, 2042 when I go out, 2042 when I walk, 2042 when I take a bus, 2042 when I work, and 2042 when I play with my mobile phone. I really feel like I am possessed by evil. My obsession with 2042 seems to be morbid. I am so lonely! It's really lonely! Do you know that? Every night, my eyes are hot, and I get sick. I want to think crazy about 2042, my eyes can't stand it, 2042, my battlefield 2042.",YHZ NGU,2021-10-08T11:28:42Z,0.216

Spent 2400 hrs on BF4, played all of 5 seconds on BF1 beta and didn't bother with BF5 as you told me if I didn't like the game don't buy it. With such a limited test period and paid shills who get early access to review your games what is the returns policy?. What guns, what maps, what gadgets, what weapons, how does DLC work.

"I think the next evolution in the BATTLEFIELD series (besides more Levolution) is body part-specific damage animations, or at the very least side-effects. Example, if you get hit in the legs, mobility would be slightly decreased until you heal up (maybe even a limping animation). If you get hit on the arms, accuracy would be reduced until you heal up. It would add to the strategy of the gunfights",Tony Richengod,2021-09-19T11:15:40Z,0.089

"In my opinion, there should be a warfare game on the current world situation.
Every country should have its part in something like world war 3.
As the current geopolitical situations says, the major countries that would participate in WW3 would be America, China , Russia, India , Pakistan, Afghanistan, France,( somewhat Germany) ,Australia, North Korea and some other smaller countries.
In such warfare game, the ending should be that no country won the war. Everyone got defeated, but the humanity won.
The devastation and destruction caused by the war killed many innocents and vast area of lands became barren due to the nuclear power used.
The remaining people pledged themselves to not divide themselves into countries and made a world union something like European Union.
I think, that would be the most appropriate and satisfactory ending ( as we cannot call it a happy ending).",Devu Khare,2021-09-08T14:11:43Z,0.185

All EA games have a hacker problems seems like everyone uses the esp hack don‚Äôt even get a chance! I guess they are trying to dumb people down with over population and global issues they do t want the war to turn into civil war so they are dumbing the senses of players when a civil war does start or a war the invisible hand decides whom will surrender!

"I just wish that they went with a warzone style of killing system. Where if you do kill someone or in Battlefield's case 'down' someone in multiplayer you can then shoot their 'downed' body and make it so they can't be revived. Such as do 100 damage to someone and now they are ""dead"" and then shoot their ""dead"" body for 25 more points of damage and now that enemy cannot be revived and they have to respawn. Because, nothing is more annoying than killing 2 or 3 people in tight battle and then getting killed by a fourth person only for everyone you just killed to get revived back up. It's like you didn't even do anything. Also if you get a headshot kill on someone they shouldn't be able to be revived either. This is just my hot take on the revive mechanic in battlefield games.",Liam Busch,2021-09-05T21:23:05Z,0.288

"So, after reading all the comments, I did a bit of digging and turns out there were two versions of it. The OG BF1942 called Loopzook, which was created by ZookaMan and Stun_gravy that got inspired and created the infamous Rendezook.
Okay, you got that? Good.

Now there's a misunderstanding regarding the last reaction in the video. First of all, that person is WARning! Schemov and he is NOT Stun_gravy. Schemov is one of the people that popularized the term for Russian viewers.

Now that's out of the way, let's go talk about the second misunderstood comment. Schemov IS NOT ZookaMan. Again, let me repeat this. Schemov IS NOT ZookaMan. Actually, Schemov has commented multiple times that he's not the the original creator. ZookaMan is the original creator.
You can easily know that ZookaMan is not Schemov by simply typing his name on the search bar, look up his Loopzook video, and read his recent comment about the reveal trailer. Now, you could check that message and read it yourself but here's some parts of the transcript to give some context. ‚Äú..., it was amazing to see it done cinematically in the new trailer. BF1942 is actually still the last Battlefield game I've played, because funnily enough, I'm not that into FPS's....‚Äù He also mentioned that he had a second channel called ‚ÄúMessenjahMatt‚Äù where he would recreated famous Michael Jordan scenes in NBA 2K games style. He finished his thoughts by saying that he would sometimes go back to both of his channels after a few years gap to do something extra but he believes that his content creating days is over.

So, now we know that the three guys are all different people. Schemov still creates daily content, Stun_gravy kind of stopped posting content (although I did heard some news that after seeing this trailer, he would come back to the scene), and ZookaMan has retired from YouTube.

The trailers and marketing have been great so far my only problem is that since battlefield 2042 will be releasing on old/new gen will old gen have less content compared to new gen like will new gen have new content and old gen will be left behind? Because as someone who does not own a new gen console i hope they do not pull a black ops 3 move and i hope they support old gen as well because honestly majority of us probably don't own one because of low restocks i just hope that battlefield 2042 will be amazing on old gen im fine with smaller maps and 64 player count because the maps are already big and on new gen its even bigger so im fine with old gen version and i hope hazzard zone will be on old gen too but aside that game looks great cant wait for open beta,Jaycee Campos,2021-08-20T19:55:30Z,0.041

Rank these games in order u would like them to be released (assuming none of them is released yet)
Battlefield 2042
GTA 6
Witcher 3
Red dead redemption 2
Halo infinite
Dying light 2
Far cry 6
Cyberpunk

So ur first choice would be released after 1 yr and the 2 nd after 2 yrs and so on...
The only catch is that the later a game releases the more polished and glitch free it will be. So ur last choice will be released after 8 years but will run ultra smooth and first choice after 1 year but glitchy.

China lead the military world in near future. Whether u like it or not. I myself, nonchinese from a country near China, also afraid about that fact.

Now they got the ability to build things faster in decent quality. All they need is just to upgrade their quality. They got the manpower, the quick production, the various biomes in their country so they experienced to some biomes, and soon they need to not just copy-paste american tech. They need to make their own stuff and with superb technology.

China will be like Japan but with huge manpower. Imagine that...",DBT,2021-08-01T04:49:00Z,0.0
